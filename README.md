# Semi-Autonomous Fire Fighting Robot

## Overview

The **Semi-Autonomous Fire Fighting Robot** is a groundbreaking project developed during my B.Tech studies, aiming to revolutionize fire safety in various sectors. Unlike traditional firefighting robots, our focus was on cost-effectiveness and adaptability using NODE MCU. The robot's physical structure was meticulously redesigned to fit seamlessly into fire-prone areas, equipped with advanced sensors for real-time monitoring and immediate response.

## Features

- **Monitoring and Early Detection:** The robot continuously monitors hazardous locations for significant temperature changes and gas leaks, signaling alarms for immediate evacuation and intervention.
  
- **Dual Operational Modes:** The robot boasts both autonomous and semi-autonomous modes. In autonomous mode, it proactively navigates and extinguishes fires using smoke and flame detectors. In semi-autonomous mode, a user-developed application allows manual control for strategic decision-making in complex scenarios.

## Project Significance

The project's vision was inspired by catastrophic events like the Bhopal Gas tragedy, emphasizing a preventive approach to firefighting. Our goal is to deploy these robots in manufacturing units, nuclear reactors, factories, and storage facilities, mitigating the risk of accidents and minimizing losses.

## Web Application Control

The robot is controlled through a web application, providing remote operation capabilities. The application allows precise control over the water tanker for effective fire suppression.

## Existing System Limitations

While existing firefighting robots often face challenges such as instability, oil installations, and limited duration periods, our project addresses these issues head-on.

## Proposed System Advancements

The **Autonomous/Semi-autonomous Fire Fighting Robot** incorporates obstacle avoidance, a driver system, and a microcontroller-based control system. In autonomous mode, it leads firefighting efforts independently using advanced sensors. In semi-autonomous mode, user-developed applications facilitate manual control, providing faster response times compared to human firefighters.

## Technical Components

- **Sensors:** Flame sensors, temperature sensors, smoke sensors
- **Actuators:** DC water pumps, motors
- **Controllers:** NODE MCU, Motor drivers, water pump drivers
- **Structural Components:** Chassis, miscellaneous fittings
- **Additional Devices:** IP camera, microphone
